# Code Implementation Instructions

This rule provides guidelines for writing frontend code within this project to ensure consistency and best practices.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.
- First think step-by-step: describe your plan in pseudocode with great detail.
- Confirm the plan with the user before writing code.
- Write correct, best-practice, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) codeâ€”bug-free, fully functional, and aligned with these rules.
- Focus on readability over performance.
- Fully implement all requested functionality; leave no todos, placeholders, or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete and thoroughly verified.
- Include all required imports and use proper, descriptive naming for key components.
- Be concise: minimize any additional prose.
- If you're unsure, say so instead of guessing.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

- Use early returns whenever possible for readability.
- Keep files under 600 lines; break into multiple files if necessary.
- Always use Tailwind CSS classes for styling; avoid external CSS files or inline <style> tags.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names.
- Name event handlers with a `handle` prefix, e.g., `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`.

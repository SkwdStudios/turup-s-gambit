## Real-time Communication

The game uses Supabase Realtime for real-time multiplayer functionality:

- **Direct client-to-client communication** for most game actions, improving responsiveness and reducing server load
- **Smart routing logic** that sends security-critical operations through the server for validation
- **Fallback mechanisms** to ensure message delivery even when websocket connections fail
- **Optimized for low latency** to provide a seamless multiplayer experience

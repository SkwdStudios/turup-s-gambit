# Turup's Gambit Documentation

## Project Overview

Turup's Gambit is a modern card game built with Next.js 15, featuring real-time multiplayer gameplay, medieval aesthetics, and rich interactive features. The game implements a sophisticated bidding system, real-time card animations, and social features to create an engaging multiplayer experience.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components and UI elements
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Custom hooks and game state management using Zustand
3. **Data Layer**: Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections and database interactions
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Authentication, routing, and utility functions

## Game Flow

The game follows a structured flow with distinct phases:

1. **Waiting Room (waiting)**: Players join the room and wait for the game to start
2. **Initial Deal (initial_deal)**: 5 cards are dealt to each player
3. **Trump Selection**: Players vote on the trump suit based on their initial hand
4. **Bidding Phase (bidding)**: Players place bids after trump selection
5. **Final Deal (final_deal)**: Remaining 8 cards are dealt to each player
6. **Playing Phase (playing)**: Players take turns playing cards
7. **Game End (ended)**: Game concludes, showing final results

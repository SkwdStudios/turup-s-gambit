                Turup's Gambit, known in the ancient scrolls as "Hokm,"
                originated in the mystical eastern kingdoms. Legend has it that
                kings and queens would gather to test their wits and strategy
                through this game of cards.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the game traveled westward, it evolved, taking on new rules
                and traditions. Knights would play between battles, using the
                game to sharpen their minds for the strategic challenges of
                warfare.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, in the digital age, we bring this ancient game to you,
                preserving its rich history while enhancing it with the magic of
                modern technology.

              How To Play

              <p>
                Court Piece is a trick-taking card game played with a standard
                deck of 52 cards. The game is typically played by four players
                in fixed partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each
                other.
              </p>
              <p>
                The objective is to win a predetermined number of hands (usually
                7 out of 13) before your opponents. The game combines elements
                of strategy, memory, and a bit of luck.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our digital version offers two modes: Classic (traditional
                rules) and Frenzy (a faster-paced variant with special powers
                and effects).
